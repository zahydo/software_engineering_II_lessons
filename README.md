# Software Engineering II 


Welcome to Software Engineering II. 

This course is designed to provide an initial understanding of various programming principles, agile development methodologies, quality attributes, software architectural patterns, styles, tactics, and, software design patterns. Additional learnings like Docker, code review, and infrastructure are included too.

## Throughout the course, you will learn about:

- General programming principles such as YAGNI, Separation of Concerns, KISS, DRY, Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work, Composition Over Inheritance, Code For Maintainer, Boy-Scout Rule, Avoid Premature Optimization, etc.
- SOLID Design Principles: Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Injection
- Design patterns such as Factory, Singleton, Observer, and more
- Agile development practices including continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)
- Code versioning and refactoring
- Code review and testing
- Docker
- AWS Cloud
- SSH

We want to provide you with hands-on experience in software development using modern software engineering practices. You will work on individual and group projects throughout the semester, applying what you learn in the classroom to real-world software development problems.

## Course Structure
The course consists of lectures, in-class exercises, and individual/group assignments. You will also be required to complete a final project that demonstrates your understanding of the concepts covered in the course.

## Prerequisites
Before taking this course, it is recommended that you have a strong foundation in programming fundamentals and have completed Software Engineering 1 or an equivalent course.

## Course Goals
Upon completion of this course, you should be able to:

- Apply modern software engineering practices to real-world software development problems
- Understand agile development methodologies, including continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)
- Understand SOLID Design Principles and use them to design modular, scalable, and maintainable software systems
- Understand and apply common software design patterns
- Use code versioning and refactoring techniques to improve the quality and maintainability of software
- Participate in code review and testing processes to ensure high-quality software development
- Use Docker to containerize and deploy software applications
- Deploy applications in different infrastructure focusses
