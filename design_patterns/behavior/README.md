# Behavioral patterns

Behavioral patterns in software engineering are patterns that are used to solve problems related to the interaction between objects and the distribution of responsibilities in a system.

There are several structural design patterns, including:

1. Iterator: The Iterator pattern is used to sequentially access the elements of a collection without exposing its internal structure. It allows to traverse a collection of objects without knowing its internal representation.

2. Mediator: The Mediator pattern is used to reduce dependencies between objects and prevent them from communicating with each other directly. The mediator is responsible for coordinating communication between objects, acting as an intermediary.

3. Observer: The Observer pattern is used to establish a dependency relationship between objects, so that when an object changes its state, all objects that depend on it are notified and update their state automatically.

4. Strategy: The Strategy pattern is used to encapsulate algorithms and allow them to be easily interchanged at runtime. It allows defining different strategies to solve a problem and selecting the one that best suits each situation.

5. Template Method: The Template Method pattern is used to define a common structure for an algorithm, but allowing specific steps to be implemented by subclasses. The Template Method defines the general steps of the algorithm, while the subclasses provide the specific implementation for each step.

These patterns are very useful for solving common problems in the design of software systems and are widely used in the programming industry.
