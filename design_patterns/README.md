# Design patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software development problems. They are not specific to a particular programming language, but rather are general solutions that can be applied to any codebase. The idea behind design patterns is to provide developers with a set of proven solutions to common problems that they can use as building blocks when designing software.

There are three main types of design patterns: creational, structural, and behavioral.

## Creational patterns

Focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. This includes patterns like Singleton, Factory Method, and Abstract Factory.

## Structural patterns 

Deal with object composition, combining objects to form larger structures. Examples of structural patterns include the Adapter, Decorator, and Facade patterns.

## Behavioral patterns 

Focus on communication between objects, helping to manage how objects interact and behave with each other. This includes patterns like Observer, Command, and Template Method.

## Benefits

The benefits of using design patterns include improved code reusability, increased maintainability, and a more modular and flexible codebase. By using proven solutions to common problems, developers can save time and avoid reinventing the wheel.

## Different abstraction levels

It's important to note that `design patterns` are different from `architectural patterns`. `Architectural patterns` are higher-level design patterns that provide solutions to large-scale software architecture problems. Examples of architectural patterns include `Model-View-Controller (MVC)`, `Layered Architecture`, and `Microservices`.

`Code patterns`, on the other hand, are more specific and concrete solutions to common programming problems. They are low-level and implementation-focused and provide guidance on how to implement a particular feature or functionality. `Code patterns` are often language-specific and cannot be easily applied across different domains or programming languages.

In summary, `design patterns` are focused on software design and architecture, while `code patterns` are focused on implementation and coding, and `architectural patterns` are in a high-level of abstraction handling non-code concerns. All of them, `design patterns`, `architectural patterns` and `code patterns` are important for software development and can help developers create better and more maintainable software.
