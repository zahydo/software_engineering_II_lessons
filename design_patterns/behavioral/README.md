# Behavioral patterns

Behavioral patterns are design patterns that focus on the communication and interaction between objects and classes to help them work together effectively. They provide ways to organize the responsibilities and interactions between objects in different ways, making the system more flexible and easier to maintain.

There are several types of behavioral patterns, including:

1. Observer Pattern
2. Strategy Pattern
3. Command Pattern
4. Chain of responsibility Pattern
5. Iterator Pattern

These patterns help to make the design of software more flexible and maintainable, by providing a set of reusable solutions to common problems in software design.
