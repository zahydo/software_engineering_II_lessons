# Behavioral patterns

Behavioral design patterns refers to a set of recurring solutions to common problems in designing software systems that involve behavior or communication between objects. These patterns help to standardize and streamline the design process and ensure that software systems are reliable, efficient, and scalable.

THere are several types of behavioral patterns, including:

1. CHain of resposibility: Allows a request to be passed through a chain of objects until it is handled by one of them.
2. Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for the parameterization of clients with different requests, and providing the ability to queue or log requests. 
3. Iterator: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
4. Mediator: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, allowing for loose coupling between them.
5. Memento: Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.
6. Observer: Defines a one-to-many relationship between objects, where changes to one object are automatically communicated to all dependent objects.
7. State: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
8. Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable. This allows for flexibility in selecting an algorithm at runtime.
9. Template method: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, allowing subclasses to override certain steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
10. Visitor: Visitor pattern is a behavioral design pattern that separates an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. It allows for adding new operations to existing object structures without modifying their classes.
