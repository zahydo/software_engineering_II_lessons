# Behavioral Patterns 

Behavioral patterns are a category of design patterns that deal with communication and behavior between objects. They are concerned with how objects interact with each other and how they distribute responsibilities.

There are several behavioral design patterns, including:

1. Chain of Responsibility pattern - This pattern allows a request to be passed through a chain of objects until one of them handles the request. It is useful when you want to decouple senders and receivers of a request and give more than one object the chance to handle the request.
2. Command pattern - This pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. It is useful when you want to decouple the requester of an operation from the object that performs it.

3. Iterator pattern - This pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It is useful when you want to traverse a collection of objects without exposing its implementation details.

4. Memento pattern - This pattern provides a way to capture and restore the state of an object without violating encapsulation. It is useful when you want to capture the state of an object at a certain point in time and restore it later if necessary.
Observer pattern - This pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. It is useful when you have a set of objects that need to be notified of changes to another object's state.

5. Template Method pattern - This pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It is useful when you have an algorithm that has a fixed structure but some of its steps can be customized by subclasses.
These patterns are useful in different scenarios, and each one provides a solution to a specific problem related to object behavior and communication. Understanding them can help you design better software systems that are more flexible, maintainable, and scalable.
