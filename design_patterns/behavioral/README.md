## Behavional patters

Behavioral Patterns are a set of design patterns that focus on communication and information exchange between objects and components of a system. These patterns focus on how objects interact and how responsibilities are assigned to each other to achieve a common goal.

Behavior patterns are used to control the flow of information and responsibilities between objects, to allow flexible and adaptive communication between them. These patterns help improve code structure, allow objects to change their behavior dynamically at run time, and improve code efficiency and reusability.

There are several types of behavional patterns, including:

1.  [Chain Responsibility](./chainResposibility.md)
2.  [Command](./command.md)
3.  [Iterator](./iterator.md)
4.  [Mediator](./mediator.md)
5.  [Memento](./memento.md)
6.  [Observer patter](./observer.md)
7.  [State patter](./state.md)
8.  [Strategy patter](./strategy.md)
9.  [Template method](./templateMethod.md)
10. [Visitor](./visitor.md)
