# Creational patterns

Creational patterns are design patterns that provide various ways of creating objects. They hide the complexities of object creation and provide a way to create objects in a manner suitable for the situation.

There are several types of creational patterns, including:

1. [Singleton Pattern](./singleton.md)
2. [Factory Method Pattern](./factoryMethod.md)
3. [Abstract Factory Pattern](./abstractFactory.md)
4. [Builder Pattern](./builder.md)
5. [Prototype Pattern](./prototype.md)

Each of these patterns has a different approach to object creation and provides various benefits.
