# Creational patterns

Creational patterns are design patterns that provide various ways of creating objects. They hide the complexities of object creation and provide a way to create objects in a manner suitable for the situation.

There are several types of creational patterns, including:

1. Singleton Pattern: This pattern is used to ensure that a class has only one instance and to provide a global point of access to that instance.
2. Factory Method Pattern: This pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a base class, but allows subclasses to alter the type of object that is created. In summary, the 3.Factory Method pattern encapsulates the object creation in a separate class (the factory) instead of directly in the class that uses them.
3. Abstract Factory Pattern: This pattern allows creating objects of different classes that have a common structure or theme through a common interface, without worrying about the specific concrete classes that will be created.
4. Builder Pattern: This pattern allows creating complex objects step by step, and it's very useful when you need to create objects with multiple configurations, options, or variants, while keeping the code clean and readable.
5. Prototype Pattern: This pattern allows creating copies of existing objects as prototypes, instead of creating new objects from scratch.

Each of these patterns has a different approach to object creation and provides various benefits.
