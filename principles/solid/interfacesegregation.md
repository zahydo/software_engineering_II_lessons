## Interface Segregation

The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states that clients should not be forced to depend upon interface members they do not use. 
In other words, do not force any client to implement an interface that is irrelevant to them.

Suppose thereâ€™s an interface for vehicle and a Bike class:

### Bad example:

    public interface Vehicle {
        public void drive();
        public void stop();
        public void refuel();
        public void openDoors();
    }

    public class Bike implements Vehicle {

        // Can be implemented
        public void drive() {...}
        public void stop() {...}
        
        // Can not be implemented
        public void refuel() {...}
        public void openDoors() {...}
    }

As you can see, it does not make sense for a Bike class to implement the openDoors() method as a bike does not have any doors! To fix this, 
ISP proposes that the interfaces be broken down into multiple, small cohesive interfaces so that no class is forced to implement any interface,
and therefore methods, that it does not need.

### Good example:

    //Different interface
    public interface DriveVehicle {
        public void drive();
    }

    public interface StopVehicle {
        public void stop();
    }

    public interface RefuelVehicle {
        public void refuel();
    }

    public interface OpenDoorsVehicle {
        public void openDoors();
    }

    //Different usage
    //Car
    public class car implements DriveVehicle, StopVehicle, RefuelVehicle, OpenDoorsVehicle{
        public public void drive() {...}
        public public void stop() {...}
        public public void refuel() {...}
        public public void openDoors() {...}
    }

    //Bike
    public class Bike implements DriveVehicle,  StopVehicle{
        public public void drive() {...}
        public public void stop() {...}
    }
