## Interface Segregation

If an interface grows too much it loses its objective and violates the first principle (SRP). This principle goes hand in hand with "Divide and conquer", because if an interface is growing, it is necessary to rethink its objective, divide, organize and group the methods again. 

### Bad example:

In an application, an interface that defines methods for saving and loading data also includes a method for sending e-mails. If a client only needs the methods for saving and loading data, it is forced to implement the method for sending e-mails.

```Java
interface DataManager {
    fun saveData(data: Any)
    fun loadData()
    fun sendEmail(recipient: String, message: String)
}

class MyClient : DataManager {
    override fun saveData(data: Any) {
        // Guardar datos
    }

    override fun loadData() {
        // Cargar datos
    }

    override fun sendEmail(recipient: String, message: String) {
        // Enviar correo electr√≥nico
    }
}
```

### Good example:

Interfaces can be divided into two: one for saving and loading data and one for sending e-mails. In this way, clients only implement the interfaces they need.

```Java
interface DataSaver {
    fun saveData(Object data);
    fun loadData();
}

interface EmailSender {
    fun sendEmail(String recipient, String message);
}

class MyClient implements DataSaver {
    override fun saveData(Object data) {
        // Guardar datos
    }

    override fun loadData() {
        // Cargar datos
    }
}
```
