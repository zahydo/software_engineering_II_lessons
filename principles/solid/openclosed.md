## Open/Closed

Open for extension but closed for modification. Organize the code in a modular way, this means that "the entities: classes, modules, interfaces, etc. must be open for extension but closed for modification". (extend the functionality of the class but this must be closed for modification, this means that what we define in this part has to be sufficiently abstract or generic to be implemented and to be manipulated and to have a much higher polymorphism) this principle seeks to make the development as modular as possible. It also obeys the principle of composition, which defines that when you have a single class and you have different functionalities, that class can be composed of multiple functionalities. A great advantage is that you can assemble, disassemble functionalities and add behaviors without the need to use inheritance.

### Bad example:

In an application, an event handler class is designed to handle the response to a single event. If another event needs to be handled, the existing event handler class must be modified.

```Java
public enum Notification {
    push_notification,
    email,
    sms
}

public class NotificationService{
    public void sendNotification(Notification notification){
        switch (notification){
            case push_notification:
                //enviar push notification
                break;
            case email:
                //enviar email notification
                break;
            case sms:
                //enviar sms notification
                break;
            default:
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Tipo de notificaci√≥n no reconocido: " + notification);
        }
    }
}
```

### Good example:

You can create a generic event handler interface and have the event handler class implement the interface. Then, you can create new classes that implement the interface to handle different types of events.

```Java
public interface Notification {
    void sendNotification();
}

public class PushNotification implements Notification {
    @Override
    public void sendNotification(){
        //enviar push notification
    }
}

public class EmailNotification implements Notification {
    @Override
    public void sendNotification(){
        //enviar email notification
    }
}

public class SmsNotification implements Notification {
    @Override
    public void sendNotification(){
        //enviar sms notification
    }
}
```
