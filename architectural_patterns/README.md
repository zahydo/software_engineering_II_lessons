# Architectural Patterns

Architectural patterns can be applied to a wide range of software systems, from simple standalone applications to complex, distributed systems. They help developers to think about the design of the system in a more structured and systematic way, allowing them to focus on solving the specific problem at hand rather than worrying about the broader architecture.

Here are some of the most commonly used architectural patterns:

## [Layered Architecture](layers.md)

The Layered Architecture pattern is a popular pattern for designing software systems that separates the concerns of the system into distinct layers, with each layer responsible for a specific aspect of the system's functionality. The layers typically include a presentation layer, a business logic layer, and a data access layer.

## [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](mvc.md)

The Model-View-Controller pattern is a popular pattern for designing user interfaces in web applications. It separates the user interface into three components: the model, which represents the data and business logic of the application; the view, which is responsible for rendering the user interface; and the controller, which handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly.

## Microservices
The Microservices pattern is a pattern for designing distributed systems that breaks down the system into smaller, independently deployable services. Each service is responsible for a specific set of functionalities and communicates with other services via APIs. This pattern allows for greater scalability, flexibility, and maintainability of the system.

## [Event-Driven Architecture](events.md)
The Event-Driven Architecture pattern is a pattern for designing systems that respond to events, such as user input or data changes. The system is broken down into smaller components that communicate via events, allowing for greater scalability and flexibility. This pattern is commonly used in systems that need to handle large volumes of data and respond quickly to changes.
