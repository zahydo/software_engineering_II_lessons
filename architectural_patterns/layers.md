# The Layers Pattern

The Layers pattern is a common architectural pattern used in software engineering. It involves breaking down an application into a series of layers, with each layer responsible for a specific task. This helps to separate concerns and make the application easier to understand, maintain, and modify.

## Problem It Solves

The Layers pattern solves the problem of complex, tightly-coupled applications that are difficult to modify and maintain. By breaking an application into layers, each layer can be developed and tested independently, making it easier to understand how the application works as a whole. Additionally, the Layers pattern allows for different components of an application to be easily replaced or upgraded without affecting the other layers.

## Description of Each Layer
The Layers pattern typically consists of three layers:

- **Presentation Layer:** The presentation layer is responsible for handling user input and rendering output to the user. Its main responsibilities are:
  
  - Receiving and validating user input
  - Formatting and presenting data to the user
  - Handling user authentication and authorization
  
  In web applications, the presentation layer is typically implemented using a user interface, such as a web page or mobile app screen. In non-web applications, the presentation layer could be a command-line interface or a graphical user interface.

- **Application/Domain/Business Layer:** The business logic layer is responsible for implementing the core functionality of the application. It's where the application's business rules are enforced, data is processed, and calculations are performed. Its main responsibilities are:

  - Implementing business rules and workflows
  - Performing data processing and calculations
  - Coordinating interactions between different parts of the application
  - Exposing APIs or services for use by other layers
  
  In a well-designed application, the business logic layer should be independent of the presentation and data access layers, allowing it to be reused across different presentation or data access technologies.

- **Data Access Layer:** The data access layer is responsible for storing and retrieving data from a data store, such as a database or a file system. Its main responsibilities are:

  - Abstracting away the details of the data store implementatio
  - Providing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the application's data entities
  - Handling data validation and persistence
  - Optimizing data access performance

  In modern applications, the data access layer is often implemented using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks or other data access technologies that abstract away the details of the underlying data store.

## Common Uses

The Layers pattern is commonly used in web applications, where it can be used to separate the front-end presentation layer from the back-end application and data access layers. It is also used in desktop applications, where it can help to simplify the overall architecture and make it easier to maintain and modify.
